## Homework

### Writing prompts

**How GitHub works (2 pts each)**

1. Describe what we mean when we say that GitHub is both “Git” and “Hub”.
   
   Git a way to keep track of changes and is important when making computer software because you can understand what changes were made and troubleshoot more easily because you know who made the changes and what those changes were.
   
   Hub is because it's a community.
   
2. Why might you want to fork a repository?

   A reason to fork a repository would be if you want to copy someone's project but put your own spin on the project. An example could be that I really like the nCage Chrome Extension and I want to make one just like it but instead of replacing all browser images with pictures of Nicolas Cage's face, I want to replace them with photos from the Matrix. I could fork the GitHub repo and make my own version of the Chrome Extension.

**How the internet works (2 pts each)**

1. Why is HTTP a thing?
   
   It's a set of rules that helps computers talk each other, which is the base for the internet. It's a thing because all of the data on the internet is stored on computers (servers) and to access that data/information, you have to tell your computer (or device) to connect to that other computer (or server).

2. What is an API and why do APIs like the deck of cards thing exist?

   API stands for Application Programming Interface and is a way to communicate between applications, devices, and data to make an application do certain things. APIs, like the deck of cards, exist so that multiple applications and services can all communicate to each other and it's a more efficient way of creating applications.
   
3. Write about two kinds of HTTP requests you make in your daily life.

   - Every morning, while I'm choosing my outfit for the day, I open the Weather App on my phone to make sure that I dress appropriately. The Weather App makes an API call to a server that stores all the weather data.
   - Earlier today, I was shopping for new shoes, reading reviews on blog sites for the different shoe styles, and searching in a browser for different websites that carry the shoes that I want. A blog, online stores, and search engines are all HTTP requests because they take data (about shoes) from other sources and return that data to me, thus allowing me to make a better decision on what shoes to purchase.
   > For context, I wore my wedding shoes out on New Years Eve because it was a special occasion (and I only wear my wedding shoes on special occasions) and now one of the ribbons is missing from my wedding shoes but I have a friend's wedding to go to (another special occasion) so I currently don't have a pair of "special occasion" shoes because I need to ship my wedding shoes out for repair.
   
4. Why do some URLs have ?s and &s in them?
   
   The ?s marks the start of the part of the URL that controls other parameters for the URL. The &s separate each parameter.

**How webpages work (2 pts each)**

1. What's a good metaphor for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?

   HTML is like your skeletal system in your body because that sets the framework for the webpage; JavaScript is like the organs in your body because it controls functionality; CSS is your clothing that can change the look without affecting the function.
   
2. What would you use Chrome Dev Tools for?

   Chrome Dev Tools can be used to inspect a webpage, see the way that the code is written, and understand what bit of code control what parts of the webpage. You can also use them locally on your machine to make changes to the webpage and see what they would look like.

3. What is the JavaScript console?

   JavaScript console can be used to help identify if there are errors with the code on the webpage. If you are trying to create a webpage, it can help you identify specific lines of code that might not be completing their requests.
