For your class journal:

1. What is the difference between raster and vector data?

Raster is like a picture with pixels and cannot be styled differently, vector is points and lines and can be styled dynamically.

2. Why do "slippy maps" exist?

To provide visibility on the seams of multiple tiles. Previously, if there was a place that you wanted to go that was on the edge of a tile, it was very difficult to see that place but with slippy maps, you can move between the tiles.

3. Why would you want to install a dedicated text editor?

They help catch any errors in your code, they insert the endings for codes for you, and they help with coloring to make things more visible.

4. What is Leaflet?

Open-source java script library for mobile interactive maps

5. How has web map rendering changed over the years?

Higher performance, and it's faster to render tiles. Rendering tiles doesn't have to happen on a server anymore and can be served client side.

6. What is the basemap-overlay paradigm and how are GL maps different?

Basemap-overlay is just adding a layer over an existing map and stacking those layers over one another. For example if you have a base map and you want roads on top of it, you'll need to load in the road network but it would just be a layer on top of that basemap. You can't really make changes to it and it just covers what you see. GL Maps allow you to merge the data with your map so that you can change each layer individually to make a cohesive map experience.
